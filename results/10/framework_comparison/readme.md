The loss functions are varied with the input data:
1. Cross-entropy for fixed sequence length data
    - default implementation from each framework
2. Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for variable sequence length data
    - warp_ctc for [Theano+Lasagne](http://deeplearning.net/software/Theano/library/tensor/nnet/ctc.html?highlight=ctc#module-Theano.tensor.nnet.ctc) and [PyTorch](https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc)

- Xeon-W 2195 CPU, GTX 1080 Founders Edition, Ubuntu 16.04
- The results reflect the mean time to fully process a batch (forward + backward pass).
- The measurements are taken over 500 runs, and the first 100 are discarded as warm-up.

Remarks:
- The benchmark scripts are carefully written, but not optimized to squeeze that last bit of
performance out of them. They should reflect typical day-to-day research applications.
- Due to time constraints, only the 1x320 LSTM benchmark covers all considered frameworks.
For the multi-layer 4x320 networks, only implementations that provided helper functions to
create stacked bidirectional networks were evaluated. An exemption of this rule was made
for Lasagne, in order to include a Theano-based contender for this scenario.
- The TensorFlow benchmarks use the `feed_dict` input method that is simple to implement,
but slower than the [`tf.data` API](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide#input_pipeline_optimization). Implementing a high performance input pipeline in TensorFlow is not trivial, and only the feed_dict approach allowed for a similar implementation complexity as in the PyTorch and Lasagne cases.
- The TensorFlow `cuDNNLSTM` was not tested with variable length data as it does not support
such input (see [issue 6633](https://github.com/TensorFlow/TensorFlow/issues/6633)).
- The TensorFlow benchmark uses the integrated `tf.nn.ctc_loss` instead of the warp-
ctc library, even though there is a TensorFlow binding available ([Link](https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc)). The performance
difference has not been measured.
- PyTorch 0.4.0 merged the Tensor and Variable classes and does not need the Variable
wrapper anymore. The Variable wrapper has a negligible performance impact on version
0.4.0, but is required for older PyTorch releases in the PyTorch version comparison.
- The CTC benchmark does not include the TensorFlow `cuDNNLSTM` implementation because it does not seem to handle variable sequence lengths (see [issue 6633](https://github.com/TensorFlow/TensorFlow/issues/6633)).
- The CTC benchmark was not carried out on PyTorch 0.1.12_2 as the compilation process was too complex. The packed sequence implementation has a large impact on performance for v0.2.0_4 (see [issue 4512](https://github.com/PyTorch/PyTorch/pull/4512)).
